# Game Of Life Computer

Innovated on a replica of the cellular automaton, Conwayâ€™s Game of Life, by simulating basic logic gates. Utilized Pygame to create a basic GUI to apply game rules and automatically draw all logic gates

Conway's Game of Life is played on a grid of alive/dead cells governed by 3 rules.

1) Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude
2) Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation
3) Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated

Using these rules, the NOT, AND, and OR gates can be created. Patterns used include gliders, eaters, and stoppers.
